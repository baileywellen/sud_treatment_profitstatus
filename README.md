# sud_treatment_profitstatus
 An investigation into the trends of the substance use disorder (SUD) treatment industry's growth as a (potential) response to substance use rates in the 50 United States.  
 
 
 This study aims to reveal whether the number of SUD treatment centers is associated with demand for treatment at the state level (as measured by substance use rates) in the United States during the third wave of the opioid epidemic. The primary goal will be to identify this relationship separately for the for-profit, non-profit, and government SUD treatment industries. This question is motivated by a desire to understand whether the change in treatment centers may potentially be explained as a market response to changing substance use trends, although it does not indicate causation. To the authorâ€™s knowledge there have been no prior scientific studies evaluating whether the count of treatment centers may be a market response to substance use prevalence.
