                    <abstract><p>The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provide substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS provides the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition of the United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. The objectives of N-SSATS are to collect multipurpose data that can be used to assist the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and state and local governments in assessing the nature and extent of services provided and in forecasting treatment resource requirements, to update SAMHSA's Inventory of Behavioral Health Services (I-BHS), to analyze general treatment services trends, and to generate the online Substance Abuse Treatment Facility Locator <ExtLink URI="http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov" />, as well as the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Programs.</p><p>Data are collected on topics including facility operation, services offered (assessment, testing, transitional, ancillary, and pharmacotherapies), detoxification, primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, and other), Opioid Treatment Programs and medications dispensed/prescribed, counseling and therapeutic approaches, standard operating procedures, special programs/groups offered, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided (hospital inpatient, residential, outpatient), number of clients (by service, total, and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.</p></abstract>

                    <sampProc>The Inventory of Behavioral Health Services (I-BHS)  provides the sampling frame for N-SSATS. Two categories of treatment facilities in I-BHS may be distinguished. The largest group of facilities includes those that are licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment. The second group represents the SAMHSA effort in recent years to make I-BHS as comprehensive as possible by including treatment facilities that state substance abuse agencies, for a variety of reasons, do not license or certify. Many of these facilities are private, for-profit, small group practices, or hospital-based programs.</sampProc>

                <notes>N-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date (March 31, 2014). Client counts do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a "snapshot" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day.</notes>
                <notes>N-SSATS collects data about facilities, not individual clients. Data on clients represent an aggregate of clients in treatment for each reporting facility.</notes>
                <notes>N-SSATS attempts to obtain responses from all known treatment and prevention facilities, but it is a voluntary survey. There is no adjustment for the approximately five percent facility nonresponse.</notes>

                    <respRate>There were 17,224 facilities in the survey universe. Of these facilities, 11 percent were found to be ineligible for the survey because they had closed or did not provide substance abuse treatment or detoxification on March 31, 2014. Of the remaining 15,351 facilities, 14,382 facilities (94 percent) completed the survey and 14,152 (92 percent) were eligible to be included in the data file. The percentage of respondents who completed the survey via the mail was 1.6 percent, while 14.7 percent completed the survey via telephone, and 83.7 percent completed the survey using a Web-based questionnaire.</respRate>
